# Java: Data Structures
This is the repository of my solutions for the LinkedIn Learning course Java: Data Structures.

Data structures are used in almost all applications, so developers need to know what they are and how to use the most common ones. In this course, instructor Bethan Palmer explains what data structures in Java are and what you can do with some of the most common types. After giving some definitions, Bethan presents what you should consider when choosing a data structure, such as different levels of speed and performance. She shows you what arrays are and the pros and cons of using them, then walks you through how to create arrays and perform operations on them. Then Bethan dives into Java Collections, starting with the Collection interface. Most data structures in Java implement the Collection interface, so understanding what it is and how it works is key. Bethan goes over stacks, queues, and TreeSets, then concludes with a challenge and solution set exploring how to create and perform operations on some Java Collections.
